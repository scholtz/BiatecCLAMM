# - Missing edge cases
# - Test quality issues
```

#### Dependency Analysis

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Review all dependencies
npm list --all

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated
```

Document findings in a preliminary report.

### Phase 2: Manual Code Review (Week 1-2, Days 3-10)
