```

## File Naming Convention

All audit reports should follow this naming pattern:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-audit-report-[type]-[auditor].md
```

**Examples**:
- `2025-10-27-audit-report-ai-claude.md`
- `2025-11-15-audit-report-human-securechain.md`
- `2025-12-01-audit-report-combined-certik.md`

This naming convention ensures:
- ✅ Natural chronological sorting
- ✅ Easy identification of audit type
- ✅ Clear auditor attribution
- ✅ Consistent organization

## Audit Types

### AI Model Audits

**Purpose**: Leverage AI capabilities for comprehensive code analysis, pattern recognition, and vulnerability detection.

**When to Use**:
- Initial code review and analysis
- Continuous security monitoring
- Quick assessment of code changes
- Identifying common vulnerability patterns
- Documentation completeness checks

**Requirements**:
- Must specify exact AI model name and version
- Must include model provider information
- Must document analysis methodology
- Must state limitations of AI analysis

**Instructions**: See [AI-AUDIT-INSTRUCTIONS.md](./AI-AUDIT-INSTRUCTIONS.md)

**Example Models**:
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) by Anthropic
- GPT-4 (gpt-4-0613) by OpenAI
- Other specialized security analysis models

### Human Audits

**Purpose**: Expert human review providing deep contextual understanding, creative attack modeling, and business logic verification.

**When to Use**:
- Pre-mainnet deployment
- After major protocol changes
- For regulatory compliance
- When economic security is critical
- For final production verification

**Requirements**:
- Must specify all auditor names and credentials
- Must include company/organization name
- Must document person-hours invested
- Must provide auditor contact information

**Instructions**: See [HUMAN-AUDIT-INSTRUCTIONS.md](./HUMAN-AUDIT-INSTRUCTIONS.md)

### Combined Audits

**Purpose**: Leverage strengths of both AI and human analysis for maximum coverage.

**Approach**:
1. AI performs initial comprehensive analysis
2. Human team reviews AI findings
3. Human team performs targeted deep-dives
4. Combined report integrates all findings

## Audit Scope

### Smart Contracts

All audits should cover:

- `contracts/BiatecClammPool.algo.ts` - Main concentrated liquidity AMM
- `contracts/BiatecConfigProvider.algo.ts` - Configuration management
- `contracts/BiatecIdentityProvider.algo.ts` - Identity verification
- `contracts/BiatecPoolProvider.algo.ts` - Pool registry and deployment

### TypeScript Client Library

- Transaction builders in `src/biatecClamm/txs/`
- Sender functions in `src/biatecClamm/sender/`
- Common utilities in `src/common/`
- Box management in `src/boxes/`

### Documentation

- README.md and all documentation in `docs/`
- API documentation
- Security considerations
- User guides and examples

### Test Coverage

- All test files in `__test__/`
- Test coverage metrics
- Edge case handling
- Integration tests

## Severity Levels

All findings must be classified using these severity levels:

| Severity | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Critical** | Direct loss of funds, protocol insolvency | Reentrancy allowing drainage, unauthorized minting |
| **High** | Indirect theft, significant manipulation | Flash loan attacks, price manipulation |
| **Medium** | Minor economic impact, degraded functionality | Rounding errors, gas inefficiencies |
| **Low** | Code quality, unlikely scenarios | Minor validation gaps, suboptimal patterns |
| **Informational** | Suggestions, best practices | Code style, optimization opportunities |

## Required Metadata

Every audit report must include:

### For AI Audits
```markdown
**AI Model**: [Exact model name and version]
**Provider**: [Company name]
**Audit Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Commit Hash**: [Full 40-character git commit hash]
**Commit Date**: [Git commit timestamp]
```

### For Human Audits
```markdown
**Lead Auditor**: [Name], [Credentials]
**Company**: [Audit firm name]
**Team Members**: [All auditor names and roles]
**Audit Duration**: [Person-hours or days]
**Audit Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Commit Hash**: [Full 40-character git commit hash]
**Commit Date**: [Git commit timestamp]
```

## Conducting an Audit

### Step 1: Preparation

1. Read the appropriate instructions:
   - AI auditors: [AI-AUDIT-INSTRUCTIONS.md](./AI-AUDIT-INSTRUCTIONS.md)
   - Human auditors: [HUMAN-AUDIT-INSTRUCTIONS.md](./HUMAN-AUDIT-INSTRUCTIONS.md)

2. Set up the environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/scholtz/BiatecCLAMM.git
   cd BiatecCLAMM
   git checkout [COMMIT_HASH]  # Audit specific commit
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run test
   ```

3. Record the commit information:
   ```bash
   git log -1 --format="%H %cI"
   ```

### Step 2: Use the Template

1. Copy the template:
   ```bash
   cp audits/YYYY-MM-DD-audit-template.md \
      audits/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-audit-report-[type]-[auditor].md
   ```

2. Fill in all sections according to your findings

3. Ensure no placeholder text remains

### Step 3: Follow the Methodology

- **AI Auditors**: Follow the systematic checklist in AI-AUDIT-INSTRUCTIONS.md
- **Human Auditors**: Follow the phased approach in HUMAN-AUDIT-INSTRUCTIONS.md

### Step 4: Quality Assurance

Before submitting:

- [ ] All template sections completed
- [ ] Auditor information clearly documented
- [ ] Commit hash verified and included
- [ ] All findings have severity levels
- [ ] Each finding has clear recommendations
- [ ] Test gaps documented
- [ ] Documentation issues noted
- [ ] Risk assessment complete
- [ ] Recommendations prioritized
- [ ] Report well-formatted

### Step 5: Submission

1. Review the report thoroughly
2. Have findings peer-reviewed (for human audits)
3. Submit via agreed channel (PR, email, etc.)
4. Be available for follow-up questions

## Audit History

| Date | Type | Auditor | Commit | Status | Report |

## Disclaimer

Security audits are point-in-time assessments and do not guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities. Code changes after an audit require re-assessment. Users should always perform their own due diligence before interacting with smart contracts.
